This repository contains the demo I used in my [.NET Conf 2022 - Wellington](https://www.meetup.com/wellidotnet/events/289204355/) talk "Building Real-Time 3D Cloud Applications with Azure, .NET, and Unity".

You can run it locally just by:

```
python -m http.server 8000
```

Or host it in the cloud, such as Azure.
